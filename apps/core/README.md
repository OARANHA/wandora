# Wandora Core

`apps/core` owns Wandora business semantics and authorization. It is the only customer-product layer allowed to coordinate canonical data, the Agent Runtime, Messaging Gateway and approval policy.

The first promoted workflow is **Ana — Assistente Comercial Digital / inbound new contact V1**.

## Current V1 responsibility

For one normalized inbound WhatsApp event, the Core:

1. validates organization and messaging-connection ownership;
2. persists one canonical contact, conversation and qualification work item;
3. persists the inbound message and durable event receipt;
4. asks the provider-neutral `AgentRuntime` for a proposed reply;
5. applies Wandora policy;
6. creates a human approval when the proposal contains a commercial commitment;
7. otherwise prepares one idempotent outbound attempt through `MessagingGateway`;
8. records canonical Wandora audit state.

## Safety boundaries

- No provider/runtime ID becomes a customer-facing Wandora identity.
- Unknown delivery state becomes `delivery-uncertain`; Core does not auto-resend.
- Discount, special price, delivery deadline, payment terms and contractual commitments require an authorized human decision.
- `owner`/`admin` may decide this V1 approval; another tenant cannot.
- The browser does not receive direct table grants for Ana's Core state.
- Transactional facts live in PostgreSQL, not only in model memory.
- This package does not enable autonomous production traffic by itself.

## Verification

From repository root:

```bash
./apps/core/scripts/verify-ana-v1.sh
```

The verifier uses disposable `supabase/postgres:17.6.1.136` plus pinned Node 22.23.2, applies the reviewed migrations, runs SQL invariants, strict TypeScript and integration tests, then destroys the disposable environment.
