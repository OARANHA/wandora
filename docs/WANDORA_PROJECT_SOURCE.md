## Mandatory authority order

Before a material product, architecture, code, database or infrastructure decision:

1. `AGENTS.md`;
2. accepted ADRs in `docs/decisions/`;
3. `docs/CAPABILITY_AUTHORITY.md`;
4. `docs/architecture.md`;
5. `docs/CANONICAL_STATE.md`;
6. component README/runbook;
7. this file only as continuity/bootstrap context.

Mutable facts such as branch, container image, feature flags, database counts and deployment status must be reverified.

## Mandatory development discipline

```text
REAL NOW
  -> PROVEN EVIDENCE
  -> GAPS
  -> CAPABILITY AUTHORITY / REUSE GATE
  -> DECISION
  -> SECOND ADVERSARIAL REVIEW
  -> EXECUTION
  -> VALIDATION
```

The second review must actively try to prove the first decision wrong, duplicated, unsafe, too broad or based on an unproven premise.

A missing Wandora table/service/workflow is **never**, by itself, evidence that Wandora must build that capability.

## Product thesis

Wandora is the product through which businesses hire, train, govern and measure digital employees alongside human teams.

Customers should understand company, team, responsibilities, work, conversations, approvals, outcomes and learning. They should not need to know Paperclip, Mastra, Evolution, Supabase, RLS, provider IDs, prompts, tokens or Portainer.

**Wandora owns the product contract and experience; specialist components lend capabilities through Wandora-owned adapters.**

`Wandora-owned` does **not** mean `Wandora-native implementation`.

## Capability authority

| Capability | Wandora owns | Specialist capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer product | vocabulary, UX, policy, authorization, stable IDs | Wandora Web/Core |
| Platform operation | operator contracts, authorization, audit | Platform Admin over adapters |
| Human identity/session | Wandora user/membership semantics | Supabase Auth |
| Durable Wandora facts | mappings, policy, projections, audit/reconciliation | Supabase PostgreSQL |
| Digital-employee control plane | customer-facing identity/contract/policy | Paperclip via Organization Adapter |
| Agent execution | allowed execution contract and policy | Mastra via Agent Runtime Adapter |
| WhatsApp transport | provider-neutral messaging/effect policy | Evolution via Messaging Gateway |
| Model inference | provider-neutral runtime/model policy | replaceable model providers |
| Runtime/operations | desired topology in Git | Docker/Compose/Portainer/Traefik/Cloudflare |

Native consoles are protected engineering/operator surfaces. They are not the customer product and do not replace Platform Admin.

## Capability Reuse Gate

Before a material new table, service, workflow, state machine, scheduler, assignment model, agent registry or admin subsystem, answer:

1. What exact customer/operator capability is missing?
2. Does an accepted component already provide all or part of it?
3. Which layer owns the capability and which semantics/IDs/policy remain Wandora-owned?
4. What is the **minimum** Wandora state needed for safety, replaceability, authorization, idempotency, audit or reconciliation?
5. What adapter prevents provider IDs/schemas/auth from leaking to Web or Platform Admin?
6. What happens on timeout, partial success, outage or replacement?
7. Would a Wandora-native implementation duplicate an accepted provider capability?

If #7 is yes, default = **do not build it**. A newer ADR must prove reuse insufficient.

## Customer Web — current classification

Implemented routes: `/`, `/team`, `/work`, `/conversations`, `/approvals`, `/company`, `/login`, `/start`.

**REAL:** login/session, explicit multi-organization selection, `Equipe` canonical read, `Trabalho`, `Conversas` list/history, Confirmation V2, controlled WhatsApp end-to-end proof.

**PARTIAL / PLACEHOLDER:** `Início`, customer `Aprovações`, customer `Empresa`, and production actions in `/start`, including real hiring/activation.

Do not rebuild REAL surfaces from zero.

## Proven end-to-end loop

```text
WhatsApp inbound
 -> Evolution
 -> Messaging Gateway
 -> Wandora Core
 -> Mastra deterministic Agent Runtime
 -> canonical supervised proposal
 -> Trabalho / human review
 -> Confirmation V2
 -> Gateway / Evolution outbound
 -> message observed on authorized handset
```

External-effect switches were returned to OFF after the controlled proof.

## Live snapshot — reverify before relying on it

```

Migrations `20260916_010_organization_adapter_state_v1.sql` and `20260916_011_organization_adapter_service_contract_v1.sql` are **live**, and both canonical verifiers are green. The internal canary has live provider binding + company-scoped custody/config. The candidate image remains loaded; the temporary smoke container was removed after the successful canary.

## Paperclip boundary — proven

Paperclip remains authoritative for its organization/control-plane lifecycle. Wandora must not recreate a parallel hierarchy/task/agent-control-plane merely because local tables would be convenient.

Historical direct `agent-hires` laboratory evidence remains valid: repeated equal requests can create distinct provider agents. It is no longer the selected V1 provider action for catalog employees.

## Paperclip -> Wandora -> Mastra bridge — proven in laboratory

```text
Paperclip task/run
 -> external wandora_mastra adapter
 -> dedicated Paperclip->Wandora HMAC
 -> private Wandora execution bridge
 -> Agent Runtime Adapter / Mastra
 -> callback to Paperclip with opaque run-scoped JWT
```

The adapter minimizes provider context via allow-list. Wandora never receives Paperclip's JWT master signing secret.

## ADR 0038 — Organization Adapter private state — LIVE FOR INTERNAL CANARY

The accepted minimum private state remains:

- Wandora organization <-> provider company binding;
- Wandora digital employee <-> provider agent binding;
- operation journal for Wandora idempotency/request hash/recovery/audit.

Migration 010 is live and remains private. Migration 011 grants only the reviewed minimum Core runtime contract. There is still no authenticated/customer direct access, no customer hiring route, and provider credentials remain behind the adapter/custody boundaries.

## ADR 0039 — Managed Catalog Organization Adapter V1 — LIVE FOR INTERNAL CANARY

PR #78 merged at:

```text
5c69cac595b7af9bd23a6496fc24a9d356027e29
```

The V1 Paperclip technical identity/provider operation is now selected:

```text
Wandora Organization Adapter
 -> private signed webhook
 -> Wandora-owned headless multi-company Paperclip plugin
 -> company-scoped config + secret_ref
 -> timestamp/HMAC verification
 -> Paperclip configured-company host scope
 -> agents.managed.reconcile(stable catalog agentKey, companyId)
 -> stable managed Paperclip agent
```

Minimum plugin capabilities proven:

```text
webhooks.receive
secrets.read-ref
agents.managed
```

Disposable proof established:

- missing `secrets.read-ref` is denied by the host;
- plugin config cannot bind another company's secret reference;
- first reconcile creates the declared managed catalog agent;
- replay resolves the same provider agent ID rather than duplicating it;
- a proactive plugin call can reconcile within its configured company;
- the same call targeting an unconfigured company is denied by the Paperclip host.

Second adversarial review found a critical scope limit: `agents.managed.reconcile()` only supports **manifest-declared plugin-managed agents**. Therefore V1 is intentionally a **catalog employee** model. Arbitrary/custom employees remain outside V1 and there is no fallback to direct `agent-hires` without a newer ADR/proof.

A broad ordinary Board API key is not the normal tenant runtime credential. Plugin install/configuration are trusted operator/provisioning actions; customer browsers never receive Paperclip credentials or native plugin management access.

The exact combined negative case — valid Company A HMAC with Company B as target — was later executed successfully in the disposable final request-contract proof recorded by ADR 0040. A separate live cross-company gate remains required before customer-facing activation if the activation ADR still calls for it.

Evidence:

```text
docs/decisions/0039-paperclip-managed-catalog-organization-adapter-v1.md
docs/infra/paperclip-organization-adapter-managed-plugin-proof-v1-20260916.md
```

PR #78 passed Core, Web, Messaging Gateway and Platform Admin CI.

## Abandoned direction — DO NOT REVIVE

The old native `digital_employee_work_assignments` direction was rejected before merge/live application.

Do not create a Wandora-native employee hierarchy/responsibility/task control plane merely because the concepts are convenient locally.

## Current Organization Adapter canary

ADR 0059 records the completed internal canary.

```text
migrations 010/011 = LIVE + verifiers green
internal Wandora -> Paperclip binding = 1
Paperclip plugin = installed + ready
Paperclip company config = present
company-scoped custody = live
Wandora Ana = 1 active / supervised
Paperclip Ana = 1 paused / wandora_mastra
Paperclip managed resources = 1
same-idempotency-key replay = same Wandora employee id

live Core = wandora/core:organization-adapter-candidate-068d30a49d9b
live Core Organization Adapter = ON
live Core healthz/readyz = 200/200
Gateway ingress = ON
Human API = ON
deterministic Agent Runtime = ON
Human Send = OFF
Gateway outbound = OFF
customer Contratar/Ativar = absent
Empresa Exemplo Paperclip company = absent
```

The first canary attempt failed closed at Paperclip's private hostname guard. PR #103 added only the internal Docker hostname to the allowlist, preserved the guard, and the same `uncertain` operation was retried with the same idempotency key and completed.

The temporary candidate smoke container was removed after validation. ADR 0060 then promoted the same provenance-matched image to the live Core. Git comparison proved no later changes under `apps/core/` or `infra/stacks/core/`; the final render preserved the existing database, Gateway ingress, deterministic Agent Runtime and Human API capabilities and added only the reviewed Organization Adapter configuration/custody mount.

Post-promotion replay through the live Core returned the same existing Ana employee ID. Paperclip remains at one company, one paused Ana and one managed resource.

## Live cross-company isolation — closed

ADR 0062 records the completed live gate against the production Paperclip/plugin/HMAC composition.

The proof used one ephemeral provider-only B company, never `Empresa Exemplo`. Paperclip rejected an A-owned secret_ref in B's plugin config with its canonical cross-company error, and the private webhook targeting B while signed with A's HMAC returned `invalid_wandora_signature`. B remained at zero agents/managed resources.

The B fixture was deleted through the official provider API. A's existing config was then re-saved unchanged to recompute the plugin worker's configured-company scope to A-only. Final readback shows one live Paperclip company, the original A secret_ref/Ana/managed resource intact, no B residue and no Wandora DB delta.

Human Send and Gateway outbound remain OFF. `Empresa Exemplo` remains unprovisioned in Paperclip.

## Customer digital-employee lifecycle preflight

ADR 0063 separates hire from activation.

```text
Contratar = idempotent catalog materialization -> Wandora employee paused + supervised
Ativar    = separate future provider/runtime effect
```

The existing Organization Adapter journal/bindings are reused; no new lifecycle table is introduced. First-time customer hire will finalize `paused`, while hire replay may return the same employee as `paused` or `active` if a later activation has occurred.

Paperclip managed agents are natively provisioned paused and require explicit activation. Paperclip offers company-scoped `agents.resume`, but the live Wandora plugin does not request it and the execution bridge remains laboratory-only, so customer activation remains unavailable.

Provider company creation is lazy at first hire but is not yet safe to hide inside the customer request. The first customer-like canary will use a separately reviewed provider bootstrap prerequisite; general self-service requires higher-trust bootstrap automation.

The current `/start` prototype is not a production contract. V1 must be authenticated/tenant-bound, use the selected organization, expose only real catalog Ana, perform only `Contratar`, and remove fake company/WhatsApp/knowledge effects.

## Next executable slice

Next: **Customer Hire Contract Implementation V1 — code/CI only, runtime gate OFF.**

Implement the paused-first POST + protected minimal `/start` path and tests. Do not provision `Empresa Exemplo`, mutate live Paperclip, enable the customer-hire gate, expose `Ativar`, or enable Human Send/Gateway outbound.

## Platform Admin

Platform Admin remains a separate Wandora operator trust plane and is not the current priority. ADR 0033 provisioning API work remains frozen unless explicitly reprioritized.

## Security invariants

- customer/product browsers never talk directly to Paperclip, Mastra, Evolution or privileged DB/admin APIs; protected operator consoles are a separate operator-only surface;
- provider IDs/contracts never become customer-facing Wandora contracts;
- no production credential merely because a role/table/adapter exists;
- outbound remains OFF unless deliberately activated by a separate reviewed step;
- uncertain effects are never blindly retried;
- secrets/tokens/private keys never enter Git;
- private services remain private unless a reviewed public contract says otherwise;
- tenant selectors are not authorization; Core reauthorizes every tenant request;
- merged migration != live migration.

## New-session bootstrap

1. read this file for orientation;
2. read `AGENTS.md` and the authority chain;
3. fetch current `main`;
4. inspect active PR/branch relevant to the requested work;
5. verify live runtime when deployment state matters;
6. classify target as REAL / PARTIAL / PLACEHOLDER / ABSENT;
7. apply Capability Reuse Gate;
8. execute decision -> adversarial review -> execution -> validation.

Do not ask the user to reconstruct decisions already documented unless evidence is genuinely missing or contradictory.

## Maintenance rule

Update this file when architecture authority, REAL customer surfaces, live topology relevant to continuity, selected providers/adapters, major safety invariants or the current executable slice materially changes.

Keep it compact. Detailed history belongs in ADRs/evidence docs.
